# How to Use ArabicText Script for After Effects
 
If you want to create stunning animations with Arabic or Farsi text, you might have encountered some difficulties with the default text input in After Effects. Since these languages flow from right to left, simply reversing the text does not work properly. The letters do not connect correctly and the animation presets do not respect the directionality of the text.

To install the script, simply copy it to your Scripts folder in your After Effects installation directory. Then, restart After Effects and you will find it under File > Scripts > ArabicText.jsx.
 
## Step 2: Enter Your Text
 
Once you have installed the script, you can use it to enter your Arabic or Farsi text in After Effects. To do this, create a new composition and a new text layer. Then, select the text layer and run the script from the menu.
 
A new window will pop up where you can type or paste your text. You can also choose the font, size, color, and other options for your text. The script will automatically convert your text to RTL and display it correctly in the preview window. You can also adjust the kerning and tracking of your text using the sliders.
 
When you are happy with your text, click OK and the script will create a new pre-comp with your text layer. You can rename this pre-comp as you wish.
 
## Step 3: Apply Animation Presets
 
Now that you have your text layer ready, you can apply any animation preset you want to it. You can use the built-in presets in After Effects or download other free or paid presets from aescripts.com or other sources.
 
For example, you can use the AM Typewrite Text preset by Arie Moyal to create a typewriter effect for your text. This preset respects the RTL direction of your text and animates it accordingly. You can also customize the speed, cursor color, blink rate, and other options of this preset.
 
To apply this preset, simply drag and drop it onto your pre-comp in the timeline. Then, adjust the keyframes and parameters as you like.
 
## Step 4: Render and Export Your Animation
 
The final step is to render and export your animation as a video file. You can use any format and codec that suits your needs. For example, you can use H.264 for web or social media delivery or ProRes for high-quality output.
 
To render and export your animation, go to Composition > Add to Render Queue. Then, choose your output module settings and output file name and location. Finally, click Render and wait for your animation to be done.
